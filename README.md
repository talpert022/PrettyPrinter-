# PrettyPrinter-

The pretty printer is a functional pearl that displays text nicely on a page. It can be optimized for printing different data structures, for example trees, queues, lists, or any string of text. The project was created for a final project for Advanced Topics in Computer Science, COMP360, at Wesleyan University.
